# FEWD Final Project

The final project of the Betamore FEWD course requires you to combine all of the skills you've picked up over the last several weeks (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.) into a polished, portfolio-ready project.

This is a "free-form" project - only minimal instruction and guidance will be supplied. The idea is to have _you_ come up with an idea, _you_ determine the course of action, and _you_ execute all aspects of the project: planning, design, development, testing, and deployment.

Below are some simple guidelines for you to follow as you begin your final project:

## Project Guidelines

- Put your project under version control using git and GitHub
- Utilize semantically-appropriate, accessible HTML markup
- Style your markup via external CSS
- Ensure your project is responsive and usable on all devices
- Incorporate a 3rd party API into your project (see below for ideas)
- Deploy your project and make it accessible via URL
